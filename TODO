switch/branch to reccursive parser
delete old implementation => switched to compiled automate
(algo https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_de_Glushkov)
create automate wrapper to get line/col/pos etc.

new output mode => allow for 2 matches on same line (don't find easy solution has to be one)

add capture groups?
